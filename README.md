# purgaTheory

## About

A simple app for creating network graphs which encodes key information on the relationships between different legal entities, which can be displayed in a variety of output formats. 

The name, purgaTheory, is from the United Kingdom Supreme Court case which inspired this project: _Belmont Park Investments v BNY Corporate Trustee Services_ \[2011\] UKSC 39. 

_Belmont_ was about a programme of transactions arranged by Lehman Brothers which was initially executed through a special purpose vehicle called 'Dante'. At paragraph 138 his decision, Lord Collins noted that:

> The contract documentation is of a purgatorial complexity fitting the programme's name. 

This project seeks to make legal purgatory more bearable.
